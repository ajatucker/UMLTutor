    <p>
        Here is some information about basic symbols that are used in a class diagram. While on the 
        previous page you could see that our connecting lines didn't have any arrows, it's because we
        haven't talked about the arrows yet! Below explains the different types of class relations, which
        are typically reflected in the connecting lines between classes. There are others, but these
        are the most commonly used. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Generalization
    </p>
    <p>
        The generalization arrow is used to represent inheritance. It typically starts from the child class 
        and points at the parent class. There can be multiple children for a parent class. To make it easier
        to identify an inheritance relationship between classes, think about the phrase "is a". For example, 
        a tiger "is a" cat, so tiger would be a child class of cat. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Aggregation
    </p>
    <p>
        The following arrows can be a bit trickier, but have no fear. Don't get confused by the what the word 
        aggregate means. We refer to aggregation relationships in UML as being "owns a" where the diamond 
        starts at the owning class, and the arrow points to the owned class. An example would be a bank account 
        class where the account "owns a" credit card.

        Association
    </p>
    <p>
        Association relationships are just to add to an existing relationship between two classes. 
        This means that this third class is just to add more information to their connection. A good example 
        would be to go back to our pizza order system, and we could add an association class called "cashier"
        this could be a handler that also prints a receipt based on the information between the two classes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Composition
    </p>
    <p>
        A composition class is simply a class that is made up of another class of objects. A simple example
        would be a room class that is made up of a wall, a floor, and a ceiling class. The filled in 
        diamond begins at the class that is made of the arrow pointing class.
    </p>
    <p>Dependency</p>
    <p>
        There are many different types of dependencies, so we'll just cover a common dependency class.
        A common one is "realizes" or realization class, which represents an interface of some kind.
