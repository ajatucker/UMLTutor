    <topLine>How do I navigate this site?</topLine>
    <p>Good question! The lefthand side of the screen, which we call the sidebar, is used to 
       navigate between sections of the tutor, but you probably already knew that since you were
       able to navigate here! However, below you can see a rough quality image that shows the sidebar
       in a redbox.
    </p>

    <p>
       When you're in a section, you'll see a handy page system at the bottom
       of the screen, which we call the footer. You can use the footer to skip around the section to
       find the information you're looking for or to take a quiz to test your comprehension and
       and understanding. Below, you can see a rough quality image that shows the footer in a redbox.

    </p>

    <topLine>How does the quiz work?</topLine>
    <p>
        The quiz just simply works by you clicking or typing your desired answers, and when you're done,
        simply press the "check" button to get your results. After scrolling to the bottom of the page, you should see the big blue
        check button, but below is an image that shows it in a redbox.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note about the quiz though:
        We don't grade you based on your answers. This is mainly due to the scenario questions because UML
        can be implemented based on how the developer feels it should be, which could mean they have their
        own naming conventions, biases, etc. that contribute to the answer. You can ignore the "Incorrect"
        result given by the quiz if you feel, but we'd suggest you consider the explanation given.
    </p>

    <topLine>Where'd you get all this information?</topLine>
    <p>
        Since you asked so nicely, you can see a full list of references at the bottom of this page!
        
        Keep in mind: this information could include some practices of UML use that have become outdated
        or frownded upon by the time you're reading this. So, if this doesn't get you an A+ on your
        Software Requirements Specification Document, it isn't our fault! We did our best. 
    </p>

    <topLine>Who made this?</topLine>
    <p>
        We're just 5 students from the University of Michigan - Dearborn. 
        This website was created and designed by Rachel Cronkhite, Trenton Stebner-Hoang, Deborah Sinani, Matthew Smith, and Alexis Tucker.
    </p>

    <topLine>How do I make a UML diagram?</topLine>
    <p>
        Try reading some of the sections to find out how! I'm sure it should help at least a little.
    </p>

    <topLine>I don't understand any of this!</topLine>
    <p>
        Are you a student to in computer science or a related field? If yes, you're at the right section! Try spending some time
        researching each diagram mentioned here, and see our references at the bottom for a place to start. If no, that's 
        to be expected; UML is a very technical "language" to be used by software developers.
    </p>

    <topLine>Do people actually use this?</topLine>
    <p>
        If you mean UML, yes, absolutely! However, the exact way it is used could vary between company
        to company or developer to developer. This is all just a basic outline of the design diagrams that
        UML encompasses.
        Oh, if you mean this website...well, you're here.
