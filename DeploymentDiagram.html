        What makes up the architecture is the hardware, software, and the middleware. This diagram aims to plan
        out how the harware components will support the software. The deployment diagram is considered a static
        structure of a software developoment. Who would find the deployment diagram useful? Anyone that is network
        engineers, system administrators, and other professions within IT. The first thing you need to do before you
        start drawing, you will need know the nodes and the relationship between nodes. Before we dive deeper,

         will be used. One will be html and css to create the layout of the website. Next, a server needs to be made
         along with a database to store users login information.
