    <p>UML stands for "Unified Modeling Language". It is used by software engineers, modelers, 
      and anyone needing to model a system. Modeling systems allows developers to visualize the system
      during the planning stages, so they can develop software that meet client
      requirements. UML is also designed to be utilized for different programming languages, which is why
      it features a generic language to be applied to any programming language. However, it is especially
      meant to be a good fit for object-oriented programming langauges given several diagram categories
      feature references toward classes and objects.
      There are a variety of diagrams that are used for different reasons to visualize the system
      to get different perspectives.</p>
