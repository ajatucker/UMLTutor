      Class Diagram
      Class diagrams are used to get an idea of how your system should be built. These diagrams will 
      show the interactions of the different aspects of the system, and when making a class diagram, you 
      should start getting an idea of all the data and attributes of each class needed. However, the Sequence
      diagram should start to give you a clearer picture of the data transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use Case Diagram
      We typically will want to start modeling our system with user stories or by developing
      use cases to be made into a use case diagram. This allows us to figure out all the different
      types of users that may interact with a system. For example, a e-charting system for a hospital
      may have adminstrators with special privileges like creating a chart, patients who can access their charts, and people
      who can make general updates to a chart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Statechart Diagram
      State charts are looking at just the system as opposed to the activity diagram that will be explained 
      below. So, typically the beginning state of the system will be waiting for input. We note the data 
      given to the system that cause a transition from one system state to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activity Diagram
      When creating an activity diagram, we want to consider the events and actions of the system from
      the perspective of an actor, the system being developed, and any other system that may be involved.
      If there are multiple actors, we want to create as many diagrams to represent their interactions in 
      the system to gain a full picture. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sequence Diagram
      Sequence diagrams will show in more depth the data transfer between classes in the context of a single use case.
      We want to think about classes as being either entity, boundary, or control classes. Entity classes 
      the specific objects and data being transfered around. Boundary classes are interfaces, and only
      control classes should be "talking" to the boundary class. Control classes are the interactive classes
      where they act as the inbetween the entity and boundary class; they are more of the "doers".
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication Diagram
      Communication diagrams will show more generally the class interactions, but in a communication diagram,
      you consider actors in the system and their use cases. Also, we want to think about the steps involved in a single use case.
