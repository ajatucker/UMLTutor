               While in a <a href="#statechart"><b>statechart diagram</b></a>, the flow of control is visualized from state to state, in an <b>activity diagram</b>,
               the flow of control is visualized from activity to activity.
               An activity diagram shows a series of actions that have to be followed before the software component in question can meet its intended goal.
               This means that often a path in the diagram will split into 2
               or more paths, because an action might have more than one outcome. Tangible states are viewed more retroactively, while activites are grounded in the present.
               Activity diagrams might use states as a way to differentiate between paths, as consequences to actions taken.
               <br><br>
               Actors are not as important in activity diagrams as in other diagrams, however there are ways to show which action belongs to whom using <b>swimlanes</b>, which will be further explained
               in the <a href="ActivityDiagramSymbols.html"><b>symbols</b></a> section.

                    You can use an activity diagram to show any task that a user might want to accomplish while using your software! All UML diagrams can be helpful in further explaining how you want your
                    software to function. <br> However, it might be especially helpful to use an activity diagram when there could be several outcomes to an action, or where something is likely to not go as intended.
