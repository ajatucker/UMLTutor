        Here is some information about basic symbols that are used in a class diagram. While on the 
        previous page you could see that our connecting lines didn't have any arrows, it's because we
        haven't talked about the arrows yet! Below explains the different types of class relations, which
        are typically reflected in the connecting lines between classes. There are others, but these
        are the most commonly used.

       The solid line represents the path of the two nodes communicating. The line can indicate the 
       url path or port number to that node.

        An artifact is typically a file containing software running on a device. It represents the 
        elements that are caused by a development process.

        This where systems can host another software or how the software will execute. It is the area where 
        components can be deployed as an executable. One example 
        is the operating system.

        There are many different types of dependencies, so we'll just cover a common dependency class.
        A common one is "realizes" or realization class, which represents an interface of some kind.
